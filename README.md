## The Observer

### Pitch
*Perception Check* is a 3D hidden object game. The player explores different rooms to find a target item before time runs out. The game starts easy but gets harder with different lighting, like a dark graveyard or a very bright park. The game ends with a surprise twist.

### MDA

#### **Mechanics**
- **Controls:** Move with WASD and Click with the Mouse.
- **Goal:** Find a random object within a time limit.
- **Tools:** Use a flashlight in dark levels.
- **Challenge:** Some levels are too bright or too dark to see clearly.
- **System:** Item locations are random every time.

#### **Dynamics**
- **Time Pressure:** The timer makes the player move fast.
- **Observation:** Players must look from different angles to find hidden items.
- **Difficulty:** The game changes from relaxing to stressful/scary.
- **Replayability:** Because items move, players cannot memorize the map.

#### **Aesthetics**
- **Visual Style:** Starts realistic, then becomes weird and spooky.
- **Mystery:** A feeling of "something is wrong."
- **Fun:** The joy of finding a hard-to-see object.

### Features
- **4 Levels:**
  - *Tutorial:* Simple room to learn controls.
  - *The Park:* Very bright sunlight makes it hard to see.
  - *The Graveyard:* Very dark, player needs a flashlight.
  - *The Red Room:* A creepy room with strange colors.
- **Random Spawning:** Items appear in different places each game.
- **Hint System:** Hints appear when time is running low.
- **Ending:** A special ending that breaks the fourth wall.
